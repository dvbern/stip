# Mappers

Our mappers are automatically generated by Mapstruct and are used to map between our DB entities and our DTOs. We also use our mappers to reset/ clear some fields if others have changed. For example, if the `PersonInAusbildung.getWohnsitz` of the `GesuchFormular` changes to anything other than `EIGENER_HAUSHALT` we need to set the field `EinnahmenKosten.getWohnkosten` to null. This is done in the method annotated with `@BeforeMapping`, in this method we use the `resetFieldIf` method of the `EntityUpdateMapper` in conjunction with the `*DiffUtil` of the entity we are mapping to see if the field has changed, and if so, to set the value on the `*UpdateDto` which then gets correctly mapped to the entity.
