# Contract-First


## Key Steps

1. **API Contract Design**: Begin by designing your API contract using the OpenAPI Specification. This involves defining the API's endpoints, request/response payloads, data types, headers, and other relevant details. The contract is typically written in YAML or JSON format.

2. **Collaboration**: With the contract in hand, different teams (frontend, backend, etc.) can collaborate more effectively. Developers can understand the API's requirements and expectations without diving into implementation details.

3. **Validation and Documentation**: The API contract serves as a source of truth. It can be used to automatically validate API requests and responses, ensuring that the implementation aligns with the contract. Additionally, the contract can be converted into interactive documentation for easy reference.

4. **Code Generation**: The API contract can be used to automatically generate code stubs, server implementations, and client SDKs in various programming languages. This accelerates development and helps maintain consistency between the contract and the implementation.

5. **Implementation**: Once the contract is finalized, developers can start implementing the API based on the contract's specifications. Since the contract has been collaboratively designed, there's less room for ambiguity or misunderstandings.

6. **Testing**: As the implementation progresses, the contract can be used as a reference for testing. Automated tests can ensure that the API behavior matches what's outlined in the contract.

7. **Continuous Maintenance**: The contract remains a living document that evolves with the API. Changes to the API should be reflected in the contract first, and then the implementation can be updated accordingly. This approach helps maintain a clear separation between the API's design and its implementation.

## Benefits

- **Clarity**: A well-defined contract provides a clear understanding of the API's capabilities and expectations, reducing misunderstandings between development teams.

- **Collaboration**: Designing the contract first encourages collaboration between frontend and backend teams, aligning everyone's understanding of the API.

- **Consistency**: Since the implementation is derived from the contract, there's a high likelihood of maintaining consistency between the two.

- **Code Generation**: Automatic code generation based on the contract accelerates development and reduces the chances of manual errors.

- **Validation**: The contract can be used to validate API requests and responses, ensuring adherence to the defined specifications.

- **Documentation**: The contract doubles as interactive documentation, making it easier for developers to understand and use the API.
